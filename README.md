# Frequent-Words-in-Tweets
2018 – 2019 CMP2003 Data Structures and Algorithms (C++) Term Project

You are expected to write a c++ console application which reads a text file that consists of  tweets and then print the top 10 most frequent words in the tweets. In order to get the tweet data file, first download the following zip file:

 Stopwords
 
 You can find a list of stopwords here:
 
 https://www.link-assistant.com/seo-stop-words.html You should not count these words.
 
 Definition of a word:
 
 For simplicity assume that any contiguous block of alphabetic characters (letters from “a” to “z”, both upper and lower case) which includes at most one single quotation mark between these letters is a word.
 
 
 A. Implementation of data structure.This will be a proper C++ class. You must be able to create many instances of this class. (You should not use third party libraries including C++ STL, Boost etc. ). However you can use, iostream, ctime, fstream, string like IO and string related classes.
 
 B. The main program itself. Your program must calculate the elapsed time starting from reading tweet file to the end of the printing top 10 words. There is no need to ask user input.
